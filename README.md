# My minecraft mod-pack works well. but this repository will help you with trouble shooting.

## 1. Driver issue(error 65542 most often).
the most often driver issue is error 65542.

This error can ussually occur when you are using integrated graphics or have broken drivers in your gpu.

to fix this error there are 3 methods:

a) Re-installing the minecraft OpenGL file

b) Downloading Vulkan, OpenGL and OpenCL support on Microsoft store

c) getting a gpu for your computer or replacing/fixing the existing one

d, additional) re-installing your gpu driver

I recommend the B method, However if the issues happens again watch a YouTube video explaining the A method
since it would be to long to read on github.

If there are other issues with drivers, this repository might not help.

## Mods and compatibility

OptiFine: Sodium is designed to replace OptiFine, and they are not compatible with each other. If you use OptiFine alongside Sodium, it can lead to crashes, also optifine is on forge, and sodium is on fabric.

Shaders: Many shader packs that are designed for use with OptiFine might not work with IRIS, as it uses sodium. Some shaders might require specific configurations or mods like Iris Shaders (which are made for Sodium).

BetterFps: BetterFps is another mod that aims to improve performance, but it may conflict with Sodium. Both mods attempt to optimize game performance in similar ways, leading to potential issues when used together.

Other Performance Mods: Mods such as FastRender or FastMath might conflict with Sodium as they modify similar rendering or performance-related aspects of the game.

Mods that modify rendering: Any mod that changes how Minecraft renders chunks, lighting, or entities (like chunk loaders or lighting mods) may cause issues when paired with Sodium due to conflicts in how rendering is handled.

Certain GUI Mods: Mods that heavily alter the user interface or HUD, such as those that add custom features or optimizations to the UI, may conflict with Sodium's rendering pipeline.

Fabric API Conflicts: While Sodium itself is part of the Fabric ecosystem, certain versions or combinations of other Fabric mods may create issues, especially when mods aren’t updated to be compatible with the latest Sodium release.
World-Generation Mods: Some mods that heavily modify the world generation, such as Terrain Control or Biome Bundle, can conflict with Sodium. These mods can alter chunk rendering or processing, which might cause issues when combined with Sodium’s optimized rendering system.

Chunk Loaders: Mods that add chunk loaders, such as ChickenChunks, may not work as expected with Sodium, especially when dealing with world processing and chunk updates. This is due to Sodium's different approach to chunk rendering and the way it handles chunk updates.

Entity/Block Animations: Mods that modify or add complex animations for blocks or entities (like Dynamic Lights or modded block animations) might not work well with Sodium. Sodium optimizes rendering by reducing certain types of complex animations to improve performance, which can lead to incompatibilities.

Dynamic Lighting Mods: Mods like Dynamic Lights, which allow light to follow moving entities (e.g., torches or light sources following players), can have issues with Sodium since Sodium changes how dynamic lighting and rendering are processed in the game.

Advanced Lighting/Shadow Mods: Any mod that enhances lighting or shadows, such as better shadow rendering mods or advanced lighting shaders, might conflict with Sodium’s lighting optimizations. This includes mods that try to introduce more realistic or detailed lighting effects.

Custom World-Generation API Mods: Mods that add custom world generation through their APIs, such as OpenTerrainGenerator or TerraForged, may not be fully compatible with Sodium. These mods might cause crashes or rendering glitches due to Sodium’s optimizations on world generation and chunk rendering.

Forge Mods: Although Sodium is specifically for Fabric, if you try to mix Fabric and Forge mods in the same setup (e.g., using Multi-Loader or similar), this can cause issues since Sodium isn’t designed to work with Forge. It’s always better to stick to one mod loader, either Fabric or Forge, to ensure compatibility.

Texture Packs/Resource Packs: Some texture or resource packs that have high levels of custom shaders or complex textures can conflict with Sodium. Sodium optimizes how textures are rendered, and some resource packs might not be compatible with these optimizations, especially if they rely on OptiFine’s rendering features.

VBO (Vertex Buffer Objects) Based Mods: Mods that use VBOs for performance improvements or special rendering effects (like VBO-focused shader packs or mods) can conflict with Sodium, as Sodium uses its own optimized graphics pipeline that might bypass or interfere with VBO-based optimizations.

Mipmap Mods: Mods that specifically deal with mipmaps (such as those that provide better mipmapping algorithms) could conflict with Sodium’s rendering optimizations. Sodium has its own methods of handling mipmaps for textures, and this might cause performance degradation or visual errors when combined with certain mods.

Mods that Manipulate Fog or Depth: Mods that modify the game's fog settings, depth of field, or visual effects (such as immersive weather or depth mods) might not play well with Sodium. These mods may require the game to use complex graphical effects that Sodium optimizes away for performance reasons, potentially leading to visual glitches.

World Edit or Similar Mods: World editing or manipulation mods that alter chunks or block data (like WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit) might cause problems when used with Sodium. Sodium’s optimization of chunk rendering may interfere with these mods, especially if the mod changes the chunk load or unload behaviors.

Custom Keybinding or Input Mods: Mods that heavily modify or add custom keybindings, mouse behavior, or input handling could conflict with Sodium in some edge cases. This can be more noticeable with custom UI mods or input-focused mods that override Minecraft’s standard input handling.
