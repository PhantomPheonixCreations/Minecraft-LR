My minecraft mod-pack works well. but this repository will help you with trouble shooting.

1. Driver issue(error 65542 most often).
the most often driver issue is error 65542.

This error can ussually occur when you are using integrated graphics or have broken drivers in your gpu.

to fix this error there are 3 methods:

a) Re-installing the minecraft OpenGL file(medium/hard)

b) Downloading Vulkan, OpenGL and OpenCL support on Microsoft store(easy)

c) getting a gpu for your computer or replacing/fixing the existing one(medium/hard)

d, additional) re-installing your gpu driver(medium)

I recommend the B method, However if the issues happens again watch a YouTube video explaining the A method
since it would be to long to read on github.

If there are other issues with drivers, this repository might not help.

This is easy to fix, but can sometimes be tricky.
