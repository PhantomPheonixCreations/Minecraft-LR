# My minecraft mod-pack works well. but this repository will help you with trouble shooting.

## 1. Driver issue(error 65542 most often).
the most often driver issue is error 65542.

This error can ussually occur when you are using integrated graphics or have broken drivers in your gpu.

to fix this error there are 3 methods:

a) Re-installing the minecraft OpenGL file(medium/hard)

b) Downloading Vulkan, OpenGL and OpenCL support on Microsoft store(easy)

c) getting a gpu for your computer or replacing/fixing the existing one(medium/hard)

d, additional) re-installing your gpu driver(medium)

I recommend the B method, However if the issues happens again watch a YouTube video explaining the A method
since it would be to long to read on github.

If there are other issues with drivers, this repository might not help.

## Mods and compatibility

OptiFine: Sodium is designed to replace OptiFine, and they are not compatible with each other. If you use OptiFine alongside Sodium, it can lead to crashes or graphical glitches.

Shaders: Many shader packs that are designed for use with OptiFine might not work with Sodium, as Sodium has its own optimized rendering system. Some shaders might require specific configurations or mods like Iris Shaders (which are made for Sodium).

BetterFps: BetterFps is another mod that aims to improve performance, but it may conflict with Sodium. Both mods attempt to optimize game performance in similar ways, leading to potential issues when used together.

Other Performance Mods: Mods such as FastRender or FastMath might conflict with Sodium as they modify similar rendering or performance-related aspects of the game.

Mods that modify rendering: Any mod that changes how Minecraft renders chunks, lighting, or entities (like chunk loaders or lighting mods) may cause issues when paired with Sodium due to conflicts in how rendering is handled.

Certain GUI Mods: Mods that heavily alter the user interface or HUD, such as those that add custom features or optimizations to the UI, may conflict with Sodium's rendering pipeline.

Fabric API Conflicts: While Sodium itself is part of the Fabric ecosystem, certain versions or combinations of other Fabric mods may create issues, especially when mods arenâ€™t updated to be compatible with the latest Sodium release.
